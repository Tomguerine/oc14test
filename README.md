# HRnet

Welcome to HRnet! This repository now contains only the modern React implementation of our employee management tool.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and launch the development server:

```bash
cd hrnet-react
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production Build

Create an optimized build and preview it locally:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The legacy jQuery-based files have been removed.
